title:    "Reliability of Diurnal Salivary Cortisol Metrics: A Meta Analysis and Investigation in Two Independent Samples"
intext:   "Norton et al. (in preparation)"
abstract: "Cortisol follows a diurnal rhythm wherein levels peak immediately upon awakening and decline slowly over the course of the day. Persistent stress exposure may contribute to negative mental and physical health outcomes via dysregulation of this diurnal rhythm. However, research on the relationship between cortisol and health has been inconsistent. Of the many factors that may contribute to equivocal findings, reliability (i.e., the proportion of the between-person variation that is attributable to measurement error) of diurnal cortisol metrics is of critical importance, as measurement reliability has a strong influence on statistical power and poor reliability will reduce the maximally observable effect size. In the present study, we first conducted a meta-analysis of existing diurnal cortisol reliability studies (n=11) for five cortisol features. Average ICCs ranged from poor (e.g., CAR=0.29) to good (e.g., AUCg=0.63). Second, we estimated the reliability of diurnal cortisol features in two independent samples, the SPAN study (n=147, ages 61-73) and the MLSRA (n=90, age 37). AUCg displayed fair reliability across both SPAN (ICC=0.59) and MLSRA (ICC=0.45) datasets. CARAUC had good reliability in MLSRA (ICC=0.63), but poor reliability in SPAN (ICC=0.36). Other cortisol features demonstrated variable reliability, ranging from poor (0.00) to fair (0.48). Across both studies, individual timepoints had reliability values that were poor-good ranging from 0.32 to 0.75. Finally, given the burden of saliva collection and cortisol processing to research participants and researchers, we estimated that AUCg could be estimated with good (>.60) reliability using fewer samples per day."
